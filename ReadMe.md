# Installation

The recommended way is to install via [**`brew cask`**](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask):

    brew cask install reitermarkus/tap/epub-services
    
Alternatively, drag manually to `~/Library/Services`.

**Note:** The “Check EPUB” service depends on `epubcheck` and `terminal-notifier` being installed. Those are automatically installed when using `homebrew`.
